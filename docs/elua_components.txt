eLua components
================================================================================

Besides the Lua core, the platform modules (docs/platform_modules.txt) and the
Newlib 'glue code', eLua uses a number of other code modules (components) for
extended functionality. This is a great thing if you actually need the whole
functionality in your code, but otherwise it becomes a waste of memory space. 
Since eLua was designed to be as flexible as possible, it includes a mechanism 
that allows the user to select exactly what components he needs. Only the 
selected components will be part of the eLua image. Please note that this is 
_not_ a replacement of the platform modules mechanism, the two are complementary
to each other, since the components are not connected with the platform 
interface (docs/platform_interface.txt) in any way.
To use this feature, every platform (src/platform/[name]) must include a file
named "build.h" that specifies what components should be built for that 
platform. For example, the LM3S "build.h" file might look like this:

(BEGIN src/platform/lm3s/build.h)
// Define here what components you want for this platform

#ifndef __BUILD_H__
#define __BUILD_H__

#define BUILD_XMODEM
#define BUILD_SHELL
#define BUILD_ROMFS
#define BUILD_TERM

#endif
(END src/platform/lm3s/build.h)

In this case, the XMODEM, SHELL, ROMFS and TERM components will be built. On the
other hand, the i386 "build.h" will probably have less components:

(BEGIN src/platform/i386/build.h)
// Define here what components you want for this platform

#ifndef __BUILD_H__
#define __BUILD_H__

#define BUILD_ROMFS
#define BUILD_SHELL

#endif
(END src/platform/i386/build.h)

You don't need to modify any other part of your code, just rebuild your image
after you made changes to this file (docs/building.txt)
Below you can find a list of eLua components and their functionality.

XMODEM
================================================================================
The XMODEM component enables eLua to receive Lua source files via its shell and 
execute them (docs/the_elua_shell.txt). If you don't need to use "recv" from the
shell you can skip this component.

SHELL
================================================================================
This enables the build of the eLua shell (docs/the_elua_shell.txt). If you don't
need the shell, don't enable this component. eLua will execute the "lua" command
at startup if the eLua shell is not built.

ROMFS
================================================================================
If you need to use the ROM file system (docs/the_rom_file_system.txt) enable
this component, otherwise you can skip it.

TERM
================================================================================
The TERM module adds support for ANSI terminals. See docs/terminal_support.txt
for details. If you don't need it, and if you're willing to miss the opportunity
of playing hangman in eLua (examples/hangman.lua) you can skip this component :)
