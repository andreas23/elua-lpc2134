eLua platform interface
================================================================================

This document describes the "platform" interface in eLua. Its purpose is to ease
the task of porting eLua to a new platform, as well as having a uniform layer
for accesing peripherals (such as PIO, UART, SPI ...) on all platforms.

The definitions of the functions shown here are in the "inc/platform.h" file.
Some of the functions are required, others are optional; see also the "adding 
a new platform.txt" and "platform modules.txt" files for additional information.
Also, for each function or function group, the name of the module(s) that use
it (if any) is specified. If other part of the code uses the module, a
"ALSO USED BY" line will be present in the module description.

================================================================================

int platform_init();

TYPE: REQUIRED
USED BY MODULE: N/A

PURPOSE: platform-specific initialization (this is a good place to initialize 
the platform CPU, as well as the CPU peripherals, like the UART).
RETURNS: PLATFORM_OK or PLATFORM_ERR (if PLATFORM_ERR is returned the program
blocks in an infinite loop).

================================================================================

void* platform_get_first_free_ram();
void* platform_get_last_free_ram();

TYPE: REQUIRED
USED BY MODULE: N/A

PURPOSE: returns the first and the last free RAM address; the space between them 
will be used for the system heap. The space must be CONTIGUOUS; currently the 
implementation does now allow for "holes" in the RAM memory space. 
If the system RAM exists in a single memory space (for example the internal RAM 
on the MCU) the CPU's stack pointer should be set at the end of the RAM at 
startup. Thus, the first free ram will start right after the data/bss sections, 
and the last free RAM is the last physical address of RAM minus the size of the 
stack. The heap and the stack will grow on opposite directions (upward/downward) 
and the heap will stop if asked to grow "over" the stack.
If the MCU has both internal RAM and external RAM, a simple arrangement is to 
place the CPU stack at the end of the internal RAM and the heap in the external 
memory (which is generally much larger than the MCU's internal memory).

================================================================================

int platform_pio_has_port( unsigned port );
int platform_pio_has_pin( unsigned port, unsigned pin );
pio_type platform_pio_op( unsigned port, pio_type pinmask, int op );

TYPE: OPTIONAL
USED BY MODULE: pio

PURPOSE: PIO operations. eLua defines a number of "virtual ports", each one 32 
bits in size, as shows in "inc/platform.h". But since it somehow needs to map 
these virtual ports to physical ports, it will ask the platform if a port is 
physically present (via platform_pio_has_port) and also if a bit (a "pin") in 
the port is physically present (via platform_pio_has_pin). 
The platform_pio_op function is the one that does the actual work with the PIO
subsystem. It receives an operation id ("op") as well as a mask ("pinmask") to 
which the operation applies. The possible operations are shown in the 'enum' 
below (taken from "inc/platform.h"):

(BEGIN inc/platform.h)
enum
{
  // Pin operations
  PLATFORM_IO_PIN_SET,                      // Set pin(s) to 1
  PLATFORM_IO_PIN_CLEAR,                    // Set pin(s) to 0
  PLATFORM_IO_PIN_GET,                      // Get value of pin
  PLATFORM_IO_PIN_DIR_INPUT,                // Configure pin(s) as input
  PLATFORM_IO_PIN_DIR_OUTPUT,               // Configure pin(s) as output
  // Port operations
  PLATFORM_IO_PORT_SET_VALUE,               // Set port value
  PLATFORM_IO_PORT_GET_VALUE,               // Get port value
  PLATFORM_IO_PORT_DIR_INPUT,               // Configure port as input
  PLATFORM_IO_PORT_DIR_OUTPUT               // Configure port as output
};
(END inc/platform.h)

================================================================================

int platform_spi_exists( unsigned id );
u32 platform_spi_setup( unsigned id, int mode, u32 clock, unsigned cpol, 
                        unsigned cpha, unsigned databits );
spi_data_type platform_spi_send_recv( unsigned id, spi_data_type data );
void platform_spi_select( unsigned id, int is_select );

TYPE: OPTIONAL
USED BY MODULE: spi

PURPOSE: SPI operations. eLua defines 4 "virtual" SPI interfaces. The function
platform_spi_exists() gets an identifier from 0 to 3 and returns 1 if the SPI
interface with the given identifier exists on the target machine, 0 ohterwise.
platform_spi_setup() is called to configure the SPI interface with the given
parameters, returning the actual clock that was set for the interface. The
actual data transfer is done by calling platform_spi_send_recv(), which executes
a SPI "cycle" (send one byte, receive one byte). Finally, platform_spi_select()
is used to set the state of the SPI SS (slave select) pin, if the target's SPI
interface provides this functionality.

================================================================================

int platform_uart_exists( unsigned id );
u32 platform_uart_setup( unsigned id, u32 baud, int databits, int parity, 
                         int stopbits );
void platform_uart_send( unsigned id, u8 data );
int platform_uart_recv( unsigned id, unsigned timer_id, int timeout );

TYPE: OPTIONAL
USED BY MODULE: uart
ALSO USED BY: XMODEM

PURPOSE: UART operations. eLua defines 4 "virtual" UART interfaces. The function
platform_uart_exists() gets an identifier from 0 to 3 and returns 1 if the UART
interface with the given identifier exists on the target machine, 0 ohterwise.
platform_uart_setup() is called to configure the SPI interface with the given
parameters, returning the actual baud that was set for the interface. The
actual data transfer is done by calling platform_uart_send to send a byte, and
platform_uart_recv to receive a byte. The receive function has a timeout than
can take different values:

- timeout == 0: receive without waiting for data. If a data byte is available 
  return it, otherwise return -1.
- timeout == PLATFORM_UART_INFINITE_TIMEOUT: wait until a data byte is available 
  and then return it. This will block indefinetely if no data is available.
- timeout > 0: if a data byte is available in the give time (expressed in us)
  return id, otherwise return -1.

================================================================================

int platform_timer_exists( unsigned id );
void platform_timer_delay( unsigned id, u32 delay_us );
u32 platform_timer_op( unsigned id, int op, u32 data );
u32 platform_timer_get_diff_us( unsigned id, timer_data_type end, 
                                timer_data_type start );
                                
TYPE: OPTIONAL
USED BY MODULE: tmr, uart (for receive with timeout)
ALSO USED BY: XMODEM

PURPOSE: timer operations. eLua defines 16 "virtual" timers. The function
platform_timer_exists() gets an identifier from 0 to 15 and returns 1 if the 
timer with the given identifier exists on the target machine, 0 otherwise.
platform_timer_delay() will block the execution for the specified number of
microseconds, and platform_timer_get_diff_us() gets two timer values and returns
the time difference (in microseconds) between them.
platform_timer_op() executes the specified operation on the givem timer. The
operations are defined in an enum from inc/platform.h:
                             
(BEGIN inc/platform.h)
// Timer operations
enum
{
  PLATFORM_TIMER_OP_START,              // Start the timer
  PLATFORM_TIMER_OP_READ,               // Read the value of timer
  PLATFORM_TIMER_OP_SET_CLOCK,          // Set the clock of the timer
  PLATFORM_TIMER_OP_GET_CLOCK,          // Read the clock of the timer
  PLATFORM_TIMER_OP_GET_MAX_DELAY,      // Get the maximum achievable delay
  PLATFORM_TIMER_OP_GET_MIN_DELAY       // Get the minimum achievable delay
};
(END inc/platform.h)

================================================================================

const char* platform_pd_get_platform_name();
const char* platform_pd_get_cpu_name();
u32         platform_pd_get_cpu_frequency();

TYPE: optional
USED BY MODULE: pd

PURPOSE: platform data. These functions are used to identify the platform on
which eLua is running. platform_pd_get_platform_name() returns a string for the
platform name, platform_pd_get_cpu_name() returns a string for the cpu name, and
platform_pd_get_cpu_frequency() returns the platform's CPU frequency in Hz.
