   This document describes the eLua documentation structure, formats and the
tools used to maintain it.

   eLua documentation is created and maintained offline, in HTML format and
integrated with the same version control system used for eLua Source Code. 
This allows the same content to be deployed both online, published on the
site, and offline, included in our releases.
   All the content pages are created and edited offline, using any HTML
editor. We're currently using KompoZer and opened to new sugestions :)

   The "doc site" structure is created by a help doc generator tool called
WebBook, created at Tecgraf/PUC-Rio. WebBook is Open Source and Free
Software, 100% written in Lua and it's usage is described in
http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/webbook
   WebBook takes the created pages and a configuration file, which is simply
a Lua Table, and generates the main menu and overall site structure, in
plain HTML and JavaScript, with regular support for CSS. There is no need
for JavaScript programming or cgi-bin scripts to "run" the site. The result
is pure HTML (and JavaScript) and any browser must be able to navigate the
 complete doc structure generated by WebBook.
   
   eLua documentation is kept on the development repository, on the /doc
directory, under the trunk, branch and/or tag versions.
   Different doc language versions are kept under their own sub-directories (ie:
/doc/en for english, /doc/pt for portuguese, /doc/ro for romanian etc...)

   Directory /doc/wb is used to run WebBook build script and to store
configuration files. It does NOT need to be published or included in an
offline version of the doc "site".
   File wb_usr.lua is the main configuration file. It defines the main titles,
menu structure, utility fields/buttons and the startup options.
   File wb_build.lua is the main WebBook build script. Some facilities (bat files)
 are included for easy build under Windows but we haven't tested them.
   To create a WebBook Structure site, just edit wb_usr.lua and, from /wb dir, run

$ lua5.1 wb_build.lua 

   Directories that needed to be published and included in the distros are:

/doc       (## maybe not all files but tests are required here ##)
/doc/en    (english version doc pages and optional style sheets)
/doc/pt    (portuguese version doc pages and optional style sheets)
/doc/img   (images, logos and art files)

  eLua Doc can be viewed on any browser, simply opening the file
index_en.html (or index_pt.html for the portuguese version), on the /doc
directory.
