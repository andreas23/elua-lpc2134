<h3><a name="over"></a>What is eLua ?</h3>
<strong><a name="whatis"></a>eLua</strong>
stands for <strong>Embedded Lua</strong> and the project
aims to introduce the programming language <a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> to the embedded
software development world. <br><br>
<strong>Lua</strong> is the perfect example of a
minimal, yet fully
functional language. Although generally advertised as a "scripting
language" (and used accordingly especially in the game industry), it is
also fully capable of running stand-alone programs. Its limited
resource requirements make it suitable to a lot of microcontroller
families. 
The aim of the project is to have a fully functional Lua development
environment <strong>on the microcontroller itself</strong>,
without the need to install a specific toolchain on the PC side.
Initially, a PC will still be needed in order to edit the Lua programs
for the microcontroller. But as the project evolves this requirement
will be relaxed, as a basic editor (also residing on the
microcontroller) will be usable with a variety of input/output devices.<br>
<br>
ARM microcontrollers were chosen for the first implementations given
their popularity, availability and small cost. But support for other
architectures is on the way. Please check the <a href="http://www.eluaproject.net/en/Status">Status Page</a>
for updated info on supported platforms and features.<br>

<p><strong>eLua</strong> is a joint project of <strong><a href="http://www.eluaproject.net/en/Contact">Bogdan Marinescu</a></strong>,
a software developer from Bucharest (Romania) and <strong><a href="http://www.eluaproject.net/en/Contact">Dado Sutter</a></strong>,
head of the Led Lab at <a href="http://www.puc-rio.br/">PUC-Rio
University</a>, in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). </p>
<p>Its origins come from the <a href="http://www.circuitcellar.com/renesas2005m16c/winners/1685.htm">ReVaLuaTe</a>
project also developed by Bogdan Marinescu (as a contest entry for the
2005 Renesas M16CDesign Contest), and the Volta Project, managed by
Dado Sutter at PUC-Rio from 2005 to 2007.</p>
<p><strong>eLua</strong> is an Open Source and
collaborative project and an always growing list of collaborators can
