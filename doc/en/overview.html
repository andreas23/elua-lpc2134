<a name="whatis"></a><h3>What is eLua ?</h3>
<strong>eLua</strong>
stands for <strong>Embedded Lua</strong> and the project
aims to introduce the programming language <a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> to the embedded
software development world. <br><br>
<strong>Lua</strong> is the perfect example of a
minimal, yet fully
functional language. Although generally advertised as a "scripting
language" (and used accordingly especially in the game industry), it is
also fully capable of running stand-alone programs. Its limited
resource requirements make it suitable to a lot of microcontroller
families. 
The aim of the project is to have a fully functional Lua development
environment <strong>on the microcontroller itself</strong>,
without the need to install a specific toolchain on the PC side.
Initially, a PC will still be needed in order to edit the Lua programs
for the microcontroller. But as the project evolves this requirement
will be relaxed, as a basic editor (also residing on the
microcontroller) will be usable with a variety of input/output devices.<br>
<br>
ARM microcontrollers were chosen for the first implementations given
their popularity, availability and small cost. But support for other
architectures is on the way. Please check the <a href="http://www.eluaproject.net/en/Status">Status Page</a>
for updated info on supported platforms and features.<br>

<h3><a name="audience"></a>Audience</h3>
eLua has a wide and varied audience, from highly skilled developers
that want to extend their programs with the Lua library facilities and
portable features, to the newcomer to the embedded world, who wants an
easy and powerfull environment for prototyping, rapid application
development, educational or final product quick production.<br><br>eLua
allows new embedded world programmers to use the simplicity and
powerfullness of the Lua programming language to hide low-level
complexities and platform/architecture-dependent features. A whole new
class of embedded programmers, with no deep knowledge of the peripheral
details but with powerfull aplications in mind is now possible.<br><br>On
the other edge of the category, oldtime and skilled embedded developers
can port modules to new platforms, offering a degree of portability
never dreamed before on the embedded world.<br><br>eLua audience would be among one or more of the following categories:<br><ul><li>Embedded developers that are looking for a fast, easy to use and powerful way of coding.</li><li>First-time
embedded programmers (or simply first time programmers)&nbsp; that are
looking for an easy way to "dive" into the embedded programming world.
eLua is a great learning tool.</li><li>People that aren't really
developers, but&nbsp;want to be able to prototype an embedded system
fast and painless, without having to learn C for that.</li><li>Embedded
developers that need powerfull meta-language mecanisms for complex code
algorithms and data description, not offered by the languages available
to the embedded development world.</li><li>Field
engineers that can go their customer site and debug an eLua module on
site, without any preparation at all, since the whole development
environment resides on chip already.</li></ul><br>

<p><strong>eLua</strong> is a joint project of <strong><a href="http://www.eluaproject.net/en/Contact">Bogdan Marinescu</a></strong>,
a software developer from Bucharest (Romania) and <strong><a href="http://www.eluaproject.net/en/Contact">Dado Sutter</a></strong>,
head of the Led Lab at <a href="http://www.puc-rio.br/">PUC-Rio
University</a>, in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). </p>
<p>Its origins come from the <a href="http://www.circuitcellar.com/renesas2005m16c/winners/1685.htm">ReVaLuaTe</a>
project also developed by Bogdan Marinescu (as a contest entry for the
2005 Renesas M16CDesign Contest), and the Volta Project, managed by
Dado Sutter at PUC-Rio from 2005 to 2007.</p>
<p><strong>eLua</strong> is an Open Source and
