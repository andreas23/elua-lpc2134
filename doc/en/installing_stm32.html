 <h3>Using <b>eLua</b> with the STM32 CPUs from ST</h3>
 <p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.st.com/mcu/inchtml-pages-stm32.html">STM32 family</a> of MCUs from 
 <a target="_blank" href="http://www.st.com">ST</a> is a line of Cortex-M3 based chips with a lot of neat features, including (but not limited to) high
 amounts of on-chip Flash/RAM (up to 512k Flash and 64k RAM), external memory controller that covers (P)SRAM, NAND Flash and NOR flash, integrated ADC and
 DACs, advanced timers and many others. They also feature an integrated serial boot loader, so it's extremely easy to program them from anything that has
 a serial port. ST provides a tool that can be used to download a program to the STM32 using this serial bootloader, but it only works in Windows. Their
 bootloader protocol is documented in a separate application note though, so one can easily write a programming application for any other OS.</p>
 <p><b>eLua</b> currently works on two STM32F103 variants of the STM32 family, specifically on these boards:
 <a target="_blank" href="http://www.st.com/mcu/contentid-100-110-STM3210E_EVAL.html">the STM3210E-EVAL</a> from 
 <a target="_blank" href="http://www.st.com">ST</a> and the 
 <a target="_blank" href="http://www.futurlec.com/ET-STM32_Stamp.shtml">ETM-STM32 stamp</a> 
 from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.futurlec.com">Futurlec</a>. Instruction for installing <b>eLua</b> on each of them are provided below.
 </p>
 <h3> Prerequisites</h3> 
 <p>Before you'll be able to use <b>eLua</b> on the STM32F103 CPU, make sure that:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>you're using Windows. As already explained, the software provided by ST for serial firmware downloading works only under Windows. It's quite likely
 that similar tools for Linux and other operating systems already exist or will be available shortly.</li>
 <li>you have installed the "Flash loader demonstrator" from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.st.com/mcu/modules.php?name=mcu&file=familiesdocs&FAM=110">
this page</a> (look for it in the "Software - PC" section).</li>
 <li>you already have your <b>eLua</b> image for the STM32F103 CPU (<a href="building.html">built</a> or <a href="downloads.html">downloaded</a>).</li>
 </ul>
 <h3>Programming eLUa on the STM3210E-EVAL board</h3>
 <p>##TODO</p>
 <h3>Programming eLua on the ET-STM32 stamp</h3>
 <p>Follow the steps below to install <b>eLua</b> on your ET-STM32 stamp:
 <ul>
 <li>connect the board to one of your PC serial ports using the provided serial cable.</li>
 <li>put the BOOT1 jumper on your board in the ISP position (it should come like that from the factory, and must likely you won't need to change this).</li> 
 <li>press on the BOOT0 switch. The green "BOOT0=1" LED should light up.</li>
 <li>reset the board by pressing on the RESET button.</li>
 <li>start the ST Flash loader demonstrator. Choose your serial port in the first screen, don't change the communication parameters (57600 8E1) and press "Next" 3 times.</li>
 <li>select the "Download to device" radio button, then choose your <b>eLua</b> image file and hit "Next".</li>
 <li>wait until programming is over and press "Finish".</li>
 <li>press on the BOOT0 switch again.</li>
 <li>reset the board by pressing the RESET button again.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Now you have <b>eLua</b> installed on your board, and you can choose the same port you used for programming as a general purpose serial port for <b>eLua</b>.
