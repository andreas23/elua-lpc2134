Mailing lists
-------------
Currently eLua currently has a single *developers and users discussion list* You are very welcomed
to join us at https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/elua-dev. Please note that the list is moderated in order to avoid spam, so you
need to join it if you want to post. Messages from non-members are rarely accepted.

Our development repository is currently maintained in a Subversion server. If you want to track SVN activity, you can also subscribe to our 
*SVN Activity List* at https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/elua-svn.

Forums
------
eLua doesn't have a dedicated forum at this point. However, our *developers and users discussion list* is "mirrored" in a forum-like format at
http://elua-development.2368040.n2.nabble.com[this address] (using the services provided by http://www.nable.com[Nabble]).

[[irc]]
IRC
---
`#elua` is the official IRC channel of eLua, it can be found on http://freenode.net[freenode]. If you can't use an IRC client (for example because
your firewall blocks IRC ports) you can still try to access the IRC channel using the http://wiki.eluaproject.net/IRC[Web based client].
The conversations on the IRC channel are logged and are available at http://irclogs.ls-themes.org/freenode/elua/logs. + 
And since you're on frenode, you might want to check the `#lua` channel as well (for discussions regarding the Lua language in general).

[[userswiki]]
eLua User Labs
--------------
eLua users maintain a wiki with projects, code examples, tutorials and media at http://wiki.eluaproject.net.
