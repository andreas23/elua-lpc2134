<h3>Building eLua</h3><br><div class="content">

<p>Up to date documentation of how to build eLua is always included in the <a href="http://www.eluaproject.net/?p=Downloads">eLua distributions</a>, in the docs directory).</p>

<p>For your convenience, the building instructions are also provided on this page.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>Before you start, you might want to check if the list of platform modules and 
eLua components are set according to your needs. See platform_modules
and elua_components in the distro doc for details. </p>

<h2>Building eLua</h2>

<p>To build <strong>eLua</strong> you'll need:</p>

<ul><li><p>a GCC/Newlib toolchain for your target. Please note that even if
    you already have a compiled toolchain, the differences in the Newlib configure
    flags (mainly the --disable-newlib-supplied-syscalls flags) might prevent 
    eLua for building properly on your machine.</p></li><li><p>Linux. Compiling under windows should be possible, however this isn't tested. 
    I'm using Ubuntu, so I'm also using "apt-get". If you're using a distro with a 
    different package manager you'll need to translate the "apt-get" calls to your 
    specific distribution.</p></li><li><p>python. It should be already installed; if it's not:</p>
    
    <p>$ sudo apt-get install python</p></li><li><p>scons. eLua uses scons instead of make and makefiles, because I find scons
    much more "natural" and easier to use than make. To install it:</p>
    
    <p>$ sudo apt-get install scons</p></li><li><p>your toolchain's "bin" directory (this is generally something like 
    /usr/local/cross-arm/bin, where /usr/local/cross-arm is the directory in which 
    you installed your toolchain) must be in $PATH. </p></li><li><p>if you're building for the i386 platform, you'll also need "nasm":</p>
    
    <p>$ sudo apt-get install nasm</p></li></ul>

<p>For each platform, eLua assumes a certain name for the compiler/linker/assembler
executable files, as shown below.</p>

<pre><code>================================================================================<br>| Tool       |      Compiler       |         Linker       |      Assembler     |  <br>|------------|---------------------|----------------------|--------------------|  <br>| Platform   |                     |                      |                    |<br>|============|=====================|======================|====================|<br>| ARM (all)  |    arm-elf-gcc      |     arm-elf-gcc      |     arm-elf-gcc    |<br>|============|=====================|======================|====================|<br>| i386       |    i686-elf-gcc     |     i686-elf-gcc     |        nasm        |<br>|============|=====================|======================|====================|<br>| Cortex-M3  |    arm-elf-gcc      |     arm-elf-gcc      |     arm-elf-gcc    |<br>|============|=====================|======================|====================|<br></code></pre>

<p>If your toolchain uses different names, you have to modify the "conf.py" file
from src/platform/[your platform].</p>

<p>To build, go to the directory where you unpacked your eLua distribution and 
invoke scons:</p>

<pre><code>$ scons [target=lua | lualong] <br>  [cpu=at91sam7x256 | at91sam7x512 | i386 | str912fw44 | lm3s8962 | <br>        lm3s6965 | lpc2888 | str711fr2 ]<br>  [board=ek-lm3s8962 | ek-lm3s6965 | str9-comstick | sam7-ex256 | lpc-h2888 | <br>        | mod711 | pc]<br>  [cpumode=arm | thumb] <br>  [allocator = newlib | multiple]<br>  [prog]<br></code></pre>

<p>Your build target is specified by two paramters: cpu and board. "cpu" gives the
name of your CPU, and "board" the name of the board. A board can be associated
with more than one CPU. This allows the build system to be very flexible. You 
can use these two options together or separately, as shown below:</p>

<ul><li>cpu=name: build for the specified CPU. A board name will be assigned by the
    build system automatically.</li><li>board=name: build for the specified board. The CPU name will be inferred by 
    the build system automatically.</li><li>cpu=name board=name: build for the specified board and CPU.</li></ul>

<p>For board/CPU assignment look at the beginning of the SConstruct file from the 
base directory, it's self-explanatory.</p>

<p>The other options are as follows:</p>

<ul><li>target=lua | lualong: specify if you want to build full Lua (with floating 
    point support) or integer only Lua (lualong). The default is "lua".</li><li>cpumode=arm | thumb: for ARM target (not Cortex) this specifies the
    compilation mode. Its default value is 'thumb' for AT91SAM7X targets and
    'arm' for STR9 and LPC2888 targets.</li><li>allocator = newlib | multiple: choose between the default newlib allocator
    (newlib) and the multiple memory spaces allocator (multiple). You should
    use the 'multiple' allocator only if you need to support multiple memory 
    spaces, as it's larger that the default Newlib allocator (newlib). For more
    information about this reffer to platform_interface. The default value
    is 'newlib' for all CPUs except 'lpc2888', since my lpc-h2888 comes with
    external SDRAM memory and thus it's an ideal target for 'multiple'.</li><li>prog: by default, the above 'scons' command will build only the 'elf' file.
    Specify "prog" to build also the platform-specific programming file where
    appropriate (for example, on a AT91SAM7X256 this results in a .bin file that
    can be programmed in the CPU). </li></ul>

<p>The output will be a file named elua<em>[target]</em>[cpu].elf (and also another
file with the same name but ending in .bin if "prog" was specified for platforms
that need .bin files for programming).
If you want the equivalent of a "make clean", invoke "scons" as shown above,
but add a "-c" at the end of the command line. "scons -c" is also recommended 
after you change the list of modules/components to build for your target (see 
section "prerequisites" of this document), as scons seems to "overlook" the 
changes to these files on some occasions.</p>

<p>A few examples:</p>

<p>Clear previously built intermediate files.</p>

<pre><code>$ scons cpu=at91sam7x256 -c <br></code></pre>

<p>Build eLua for the AT91SAM7X256 CPU. The board name is detected as sam7-ex256.</p>

<pre><code>$ scons cpu=at91sam7x256<br></code></pre>

<p>Build eLua for the SAM7-EX256 board. The CPU is detected as AT91SAM7X256.</p>

<pre><code>$ scons board=sam7-ex256<br></code></pre>

<p>Build eLua for the SAM7-EX256 board, but "overwrite" the default CPU. This is 
useful when you'd like to see how the specified board would behave with a 
different CPU (in the case of the SAM7-EX256 board it's possible to switch the
on-board AT91SAM7X256 CPU for an AT91SAM7X512 which has the same pinout but 
comes with more Flash/RAM memory).</p>

<pre><code>$ scons board=sam7-ex256 cpu=at91sam7x512<br></code></pre>

<p>Build eLua for the lpc2888 CPU. The board name is detected as LPC-H2888. Also,
the bin file required for target programming is generated.</p>

<pre><code>$ scons cpu=lpc2888 prog <br></code></pre>
