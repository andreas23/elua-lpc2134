<h3>The platform interface</h3>
<p>The platform interface is the part of <b>eLua</b> that makes it easily portable between different hardware platforms by grouping the common elements
  of all platforms supported by <b>eLua</b> in a common interface. For more details about the platform interface and the overall structure of 
  <b>eLua</b> in general, check <a href="arch_overview.html">this link</a>.<br>
  The platform interface is defined in the <i>inc/platform.h</i> header file from the <b>eLua</b> source distribution. It is a collection of various 
  components (UART, SPI, timers ...), each of them is detailed in the next subsections.
