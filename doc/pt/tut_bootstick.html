      <div class="content">

<p>This is follow up of <a href="http://www.eluaproject.net/en/Booting_your_PC_in_eLua">this tutorial</a>.
After completing it you'll be able to boot eLua directly from your USB
stick (provided, of course, that your computer can boot from an USB
stick, which is true for most computers nowadays). You might want to
check the <a href="http://www.eluaproject.net/en/Booting_your_PC_in_eLua">boot your PC in eLua</a>
tutorial first for more details. If you have an old USB stick that you
don't use anymore, and/or the shear geekness of this idea makes you
feel curious, this tutorial is definitely for you :)</p>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

<p><strong>As mentioned <a href="http://www.eluaproject.net/en/Booting_your_PC_in_eLua">here</a>,
the code won't try to access any kind of storage (HDD, CDROM, floppy),
not even for reading, so you don't need to worry about that. Also it
doesn't try to reprogram your video card registers, so it can't harm it
or your monitor. It only implements a "protected mode keyboard driver"
that can't physically damage anything in your system. In short, I made
every effort to make the code as harmless as possible. I tested it on 5
different computers and in 2 <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>
emulators, and nothing bad happened. That said, there are no warranties
of any kind. In the very unlikely event that something bad does happen
to your system, you have my sincere sympathy, but I can't be held
responsible for that. Also, I can't be held responsible if you mess up
your HDD by failing the GRUB installation procedure (even though, once
again, this shouldn't be possible unless you really insist on messing
it up). If you're new to computers, this tutorial might not be for you.
Your call.</strong></p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>To have your own bootable eLua USB stick you'll need:</p>

<ul><li>an USB stick. I tested this on an 128M USB stick, because
it's the smallest I could find. You should be OK with a 4M stick or
even a 2M stick</li><li>a computer running Linux. I use Ubuntu, but any other distribution is fine.</li><li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/">GRUB</a>.
Since you're running Linux, chances are you're already using GRUB as
your bootloader. If not, you must install it on your HDD, or at least
know how to install it directly on the USB stick. I won't go into
details here, google it and you'll find lots of good articles about
GRUB. This tutorial assumes that you're using GRUB as your bootloader.</li><li>The eLua ELF file. Download it from <a href="http://elua.berlios.de/surprise">here</a>. OR <a href="http://www.eluaproject.net/en/Downloads">download eLua</a> and compile it for the i386 architecture using a toolchain that you can build by following <a href="http://www.eluaproject.net/en/Building_GCC_for_i386">this tutorial</a>.</li><li>a text editor to edit your GRUB configuration file.</li></ul>


<p>The rest of this tutorial assumes that you're using Linux with GRUB,
and that GRUB is located in /boot/grub, which is true for many Linux
distributions.</p>
<h2>Backup your stick</h2>

<p>Since the stick is going to be formatted, make sure to backup the
data from your stick first (you can copy it back after finishing the
tutorial).</p>

<h2>Partition and format your stick</h2>

<p>Depending on your stick, this step might not be required, but
chances are you'll need to re-partition and re-format your stick before
installing GRUB on it. The problem is that many sticks have a very
creative, non-standard partition table, and GRUB doesn't like that. I
looked at the partition table on my eLua USB stick, and it scared me to
death, so I had to follow this procedure. In short, you'll need to
delete all the partitions from your stick, create a new partition, and
then format it. For a step by step tutorial check here.</p>
<h2>Install GRUB on your stick</h2>

<p>First, mount your freshly formatted stick (I'm going to assume that the mount directory is /mnt):</p>

<pre><code>  $ sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt<br></code></pre>


<p>(of course, you'll need to change /dev/sda1 to reflect the physical location of your USB stick).
Then copy the required GRUB files to your stick:</p>

<pre><code>  $ cd /mnt<br>  $ mkdir boot<br>  $ mkdir boot/grub<br>  $ cd /boot/grub<br>  $ cp stage1 fat_stage1_5 stage2 /mnt/boot/grub<br></code></pre>


<p>Copy the <a href="http://elua.berlios.de/surprise">eLua ELF file</a> to the GRUB directory as well:</p>

<pre><code>  $ cp surprise /mnt/boot/grub<br></code></pre>


<p>Create a menu.lst file for GRUB with you favorite text editor (I'm using joe):</p>

<pre><code>  $ cd /mnt/boot/grub<br>  $ joe menu.lst<br>   title Surprise!<br>   root (hd0,0)<br>   kernel /boot/grub/surprise<br>   boot<br></code></pre>

<p>Now it's time to actually install GRUB on the stick.</p>

<pre><code>  $ sudo -s -H<br>  # grub<br>  Now we need to find the GRUB name of our USB stick. We'll use the "find" command from<br>  GRUB and our "surprise" file to accomplish this:<br><br>  grub&gt; find /boot/grub/surprise<br>  (hd2,0)<br><br>  GRUB should respond with a single line (like (hd2,0) above). If it gives you more <br>  than one line, something is wrong. Maybe you also installed eLua on your HDD? If so, <br>  delete the /boot/grub/surprise file from your HDD and try again.<br>  You might get a different (hdx,y) line. If so, just use it instead of (hd2,0) in the rest of <br>  this tutorial.<br><br>  grub&gt; root (hd2,0)<br>  grub&gt; setup (hd2)<br>   Checking if "/boot/grub/stage1" exists... yes<br>   Checking if "/boot/grub/stage2" exists... yes<br>   Checking if "/boot/grub/fat_stage1_5" exists... yes<br>   Running "embed /boot/grub/fat_stage1_5 (hd2)"...  15 sectors are embedded.<br>   succeeded<br>   Running "install /boot/grub/stage1 (hd2) (hd2)1+15 p (hd2,0)/boot/grub/stage2<br>   /boot/grub/menu.lst"... succeeded<br>  Done. <br>  grub&gt; quit<br></code></pre>


<p>That's it! Now reboot your computer, make sure that your BIOS is set
to boot from USB, and enjoy! You can even type dofile "/rom/bisect.lua"
to execute the "bisect.lua" test file.
